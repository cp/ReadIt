## A No BS News Reader
For those of us who just want to read news, not play around. Uses [Instapaper's](http://instapaper.com) handy mobilizer for extracting the content from posts. Built on [Feedbin's](http://feedbin.me) [API](https://github.com/feedbin/feedbin-api). Feel free to fork this and add support for your favorite RSS service.

## Sidenotes
- It's not pretty. It's not supposed to be pretty, and never will be. The goal is to have as little CSS as possible.
- It's still a work in progress

## Hosted
The app is hosted on [Heroku's](http://heroku.com) free plan. It may go down at any time, but you're welcome to host it yourself. You can find it [here](http://ca-readit.herokuapp.com)

## Todo
- Add a simple caching layer so that we're not making so many calls to the Feedbin API.
